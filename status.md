Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
We have finalized all the posible story lines and began to draw the pictures for our story book should be complete by wednesday. We also have done research into the interactive section.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We still have to code, but I'm sure we can both knock that out in a few hours if we sit and really figure it out. Trying to understand the full concept before we start and confuse ourselves more.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

None, really just trying to figure out the interactive portion.
